# Email-slicer
Python 
Email Slicer is just a simple tool that will take an email address as input and slice it to produce the username and the domain associated with it. The email must be divided into two strings by using ‘@’ as the separator.

For example

Input:

InterviewBit@gmail.com
 Output:

Your username is InterviewBit & domain is gmail.com
Here we got InterviewBit as the username and gmail.com as a domain.
